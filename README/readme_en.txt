--- INSTALLATION ---

0)
The desktop use of Open Sankey requires:
- a local web server,
- php v.5 or later. "Magic quotes" must be ON in the configuration of php.

1)
The "open-sankey" folder must be located in a directory of the local web server. For instance, on macos x, in a sub-directory of "~/sites".

2)
Check that the folders placed in "sources/user_sankey" are in "read/write" mode (the server must be able to create file in these folders).   


--- UTILIZATION ---

To launch the app, open the url corresponding to the file "open-sankey/index.php" in a web browser. 
For instance, on macos x : "http://localhost/~user/open-sankey/index.php".
The app is a priori not compatible with Internet Explorer.
